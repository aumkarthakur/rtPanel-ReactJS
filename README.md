### Tech

I used following code libraries and packages:

* React JS - for building Components!
* React Router 4 - for smooth routing without reloding browser.
* jQuery - for http request, since bootstrap need it I used jQuery instead of axios for http call.
* Twitter Bootstrap - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* WordPress Rest API - for getting posts & pages.
* Webpack - module bundler
* Underscores - starter WordPress Theme


### Installation

Dillinger requires WordPress Rest API Enabled.

  - Download zip of this repo.
  - Now install it on WordPress like normal theme.
  - Make sure REST API is enabled.
  - For menus to display make sure menu name is `menu-1`
  - Also change permalink structure to `post-name`
  - Everything should work fine!
